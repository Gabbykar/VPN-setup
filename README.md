<h1>How to Setup and Use a VPN | ProtonVPN</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I create an Azure VM (Virtual Machine) where I download, install, and use a free VPN (Virtual Private Network) called ProtonVPN. <br />
<br />
VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) allow you to connect to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing security. Two commons ways VPNs are used are, for companies to allow for remote work, and accessing different content that otherwise would be unavailable without a VPN.  
<br/>


<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>ProtonVPN</b>


<h2>Project Walk-through:</h2>

<br />
<br />
Now, I can head over to ProtonVPN and sign up for a free account:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After I made my account, now I can download the windows version in the downloads tab:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The download will start and then I'll install the VPN client. It will then have a pop-up for me to sign in with my ProtonVPN account I just made:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After I sign in, it will take me to the homepage where I can start a VPN connection:  <br/>

I'll click on "Quick Connect" and it will choose and start a VPN connection for me:

<br />
<br />
Now, if i go back to the IP address website and refresh the page, it shows me that I am in Romainia instead of Canada, and I have another different IP address:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Also, while connected to the VPN I can go to different sites like, www.google.com and www.netflix.com to see the difference compared to if I were on these sites within my own physical computers browser:  <br/>
