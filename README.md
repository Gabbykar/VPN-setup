<h1>How to Setup and Use a VPN | ProtonVPN</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I have downloaded and installed a VPN and watch as traffic passes through the network using a VPN. (Free Proton). <br />
<br />
VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) allow you to connect to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing security. Two commons ways VPNs are used are, for companies to allow for remote work, and accessing different content that otherwise would be unavailable without a VPN.  
<br/>


<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>
