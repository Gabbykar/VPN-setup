<h1>How to Setup and Use a VPN | ProtonVPN</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I create an Azure VM (Virtual Machine) where I download, install, and use a free VPN (Virtual Private Network) called ProtonVPN. <br />
<br />
VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) allow you to connect to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing security. Two commons ways VPNs are used are, for companies to allow for remote work, and accessing different content that otherwise would be unavailable without a VPN.  
<br/>


<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>
